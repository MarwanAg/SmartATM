# SmartATM
The SmartATM project simulates ATM operations (deposits, withdrawals, balance checks) using dummy data stored in JSON. It applies Java concepts like OOP (encapsulation, abstraction, single responsibility), collections, enums, ArrayList, HashMap, adapters, layered architecture, file handling, utilities, and exception management.
